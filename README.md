Documentation: I made my original entity and checked it with Randolph, and he told me that I was missing the components, decoder, elevator controller, TDM4 and clock divider. Once he told me that I created the one I submitted, and referred to the given top_basys to see connections. He also told me that I need to ground my anode, and that I needed to put the number of bits on my wires. He also referred me to the directions to notice that it said I needed to use the and and or gates.
